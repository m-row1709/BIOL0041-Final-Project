# BIOL0041-Final-Project
Markdowns and Files for my BIOL0041 Final Project.

There is one R Markdown file that contains all code used in the project. I have attempted to break it down with subheadings.

The folder labelled 'Data' contains the initial data files provided for me by my supervisor, as well as the resultant files after cleaning in Git Bash.

Files that are produced throughout the code and are then immediately, or later, imported and used have not been included.

The files and the markdown should be sufficient to recreate all work done. 

Enjoy.
